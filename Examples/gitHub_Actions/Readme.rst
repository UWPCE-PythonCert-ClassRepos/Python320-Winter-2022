These are example files needed for the gitHub classroom gitHub Actions.

``code_checks.yml``:

    This is the main YAML file that defines the gitHub actions

``requirements.txt``:

    This is where you specify what non-standard libraries your project needs, e.g. pandas, loguru, peewee, ...

``.coveragerc``

    This is where you can configure how coverage is run -- in particular you can specify files to exclude.
