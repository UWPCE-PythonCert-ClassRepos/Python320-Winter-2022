Things we noticed in reviewing your work
========================================

useful logging messages
-----------------------

logging can be used to debug, but more at the application level than the code level. So you really want your messages to be meaningful to someone operating / configuring the app that may not be familiar with the code.

e.g.
``f"delete status message failed, id:{status_id} not in database"``
rather than:

"delete_status returned False"
